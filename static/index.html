            <h2 class="title">Global Vulnerabilities to Urban Transmission of Yellow Fever Virus </h1>
              <p>In 2016, 11 foreign workers from Angola carrying the yellow fever (YF) virus travelled to urban areas in China. This led to the first reported case of YF ever in Asia. More alarmingly, transmission occurred despite China having a policy that requires all international travellers arriving from YF-endemic countries, including Angola, to provide proof of vaccination. The confluence of climate change, rapid urbanization and international air travel are accelerating the globalization of mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever.

            <h2 class="title">Where are Travellers Arriving From?</h1>
              <p>Over 4 billion passengers travel on commercial flights annually. In 2016 alone, over 45 million individuals travelled from YF-endemic areas.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Where are Travellers Going?</h1>
              <p>Of those 45 million individuals, around 18% (8M) travelled to or near YF-endemic areas, while approximately 26% (12M) travelled to or near YF-suitable areas. This shows that the risk of transmission not only extends to other endemic areas, but also to suitable populations.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Proof of Vaccination</h1>
              <p>Further analysis of the numbers also shows this: of the 12M people who travelled from YF-endemic areas to or near YF-suitable areas, 62% (~7M) went to countries that do not require proof of vaccination upon arrival. Similarly, of the 15M others who travelled from non-endemic areas to or near YF-endemic areas, over 76% (~11M) went to countries where such proof is also not required.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Conclusion</h1>
              <p>Several problems exist to further worsen the potential for a YF outbreak, including:  </p> 
              <ul>
              <li>The limited existing global stock of the YF vaccine</li>
              <li>The inconsistent implementation of vaccination policies even across countries that have them</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
              These challenges compound to set the stage for an alarming ease with which individuals can now transport the YF virus across international borders and possibly spark an urban YF epidemic worldwide. Furthermore, there are a scarce total of four WHO-qualified YF vaccine manufacturers in the world; if such an epidemic were to occur, the demand for vaccines could glaringly exceed supply.
              </p>
              <p>
              Interestingly, several of the cities suitable for YF transmission also house some of the largest populations and receive the highest traveller volumes from YF-endemic areas. Since less than 40% of travellers from YF-endemic to suitable cities are required to provide proof of vaccination upon arrival, this poses a greater risk to the health of citizens in these cities. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Similarly, less than 25% of travellers from non-endemic to endemic cities are required to provide proof of vaccination upon arrival. Not only are these individuals in danger of becoming infected, but also of potentially exporting the virus to their home countries. 
              </p>
              <p>
              4 cases of YF were recently imported into Europe in the span of 8 months by travellers from South America. The last time this happened in Europe? It took a total time period of 27 years. </p>
