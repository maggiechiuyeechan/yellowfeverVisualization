            <h2 class="title">How vulnerable is the world to Yellow Fever?</h1>
              <p>In December 2015, Angola reported its first locally acquired case of yellow fever in nearly a decade. The epidemic first appeared in the city of Luanda, then spread across Angola’s 18 provinces resulting in 5,231 suspected or confirmed cases and 498 deaths. International travellers then imported the yellow fever virus into Kenya, the Democratic of Congo and urban centres in China, signifying the first time yellow fever has been reported in Asia. While travel vaccination policies exist to prevent the international dispersion of yellow fever, its spread from Luanda into China in 2016 exposed the travel policies’ shortcomings. In our era, the confluence of climate change, rapid urbanization and international air travel are accelerating the globalization of mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever. But what exactly are the global pathways via which yellow fever could disseminate to trigger epidemics in urban areas around the world and what are the key gaps in existing yellow fever travel vaccination policies and practices?

            <h2 class="title">Activity between endemic and yellow fever suitable areas</h1>
              <p>Of these travellers, 19.6 million departed from yellow fever endemic areas and 14.9 million departed from yellow fever suitable areas.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Proof of Vaccination</h1>
              <p>74.6% of travelers landed in countries where proof of Yellow Fever vaccination is not required on arrival. This reveals a key policy gap in protecting international travelers against Yellow Fever transmission.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Conclusion</h1>
              <p>With more than four billion passengers now boarding commercial flights every year, humans have become primary agents for the global spread of mosquito-borne viruses. At a time when global Yellow Fever vaccine supplies are significantly diminished, an epidemic of Yellow Fever in a densely populated city could have catastrophic health and economic consequences. There is a pressing need for the global community to carefully reexamine existing Yellow Fever travel vaccination policies and practices to prevent urban epidemics.</p>
